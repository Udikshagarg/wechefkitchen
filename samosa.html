       For the Filling:

      1. Heat a little oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
      2. Add grated ginger and chopped green chilies. Saut√© for a minute.

      5. Stir in the chopped coriander leaves and remove from heat. Allow the mixture to cool.

      For Assembling and Frying:

     1.Divide the dough into equal portions and shape them into balls. Roll each ball into a thin oval or circle.
     2. Cut the rolled dough in half to form two semi-circles.
     3. Take one semi-circle, apply water along the straight edge, and fold it to form a cone shape.
     4. Fill the cone with the prepared potato-peas mixture. Seal the open edge using a little water to make a triangular pocket.
     5. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
     6. Carefully slide the samosas into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy.
     7. Remove the fried samosas and drain excess oil on a paper towel.
     8. Serve hot with mint chutney, tamarind chutney, or ketchup.
